# Personal_Projects
These are my personal projects.

### Image_enhancing:
This project was done to try and improve the qualities of a low quality image based of the qualities of a better/higher quality image.

### Ireland_NewsClassifer:
My solution code to a kaggle competition. Dataset couldn't upload.

### Natural Disaster Tweets Classification 1 & 2(redo):
My solution code(rough work) to a kaggle competition. A neural network, a random forest and naive bayes classifier were used in kaggle_1 and a GRU was used in kaggle_1_redo. 

### Plane Crash and Plane_crash_upload:
My solution code to a HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge (link: https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/airplane-accident-severity-hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge/).
Plane Crash.ipynb : has the rough work code using various classifiers and neural network, Plane_crash_upload.ipynb : has the clean code for uploading.

### AI_6:
First group project presented for the first half of AI saturday cohort. Here we tried to predict how much someone will spend on a black friday event based of certain features.

### Test Solutions:
These are my solutions to a test given to me by a financial technology start up company on sentiment analysis.
The text dataset used for digital banking, investment and savings, loans, and personal finance management were mined off nairaland and engineered to make analysis a lot easier. Some text data seem smaller than others, this was done to make sure the data gotten was as
useful as possible and not containing irrelevances.

### Pattern Detector:
The pattern detector is a model that detects trends/patterns in a users daily transaction. The data was created by me due to the 
fact that I could not find any useful data online. The lstm model is trained on Book1.csv and then predicts Book2.csv. 
The model performed a poorly.I believe with large enough data, the model should perform better. This project is part of a larger project
 hence its functionality would be improved upon.

### Multi label image classification:
This is the act of assigning tags/labels to images. Here I trained the model on a car dataset i created, hence the data was little.
Although the accuracy was okay, the performance wasn't all that fantastic.

### Multi image classification: 
This was an ICLR competion on classifying images that contained healthy wheat, leaf rust and stem rust.
Due to certain technical issues I was not able to submit before the deadline but this is my solution to the competition, and the accuracy was achieved after lots of tweaking. I believe by using transfer learning the accuracy score can be increased.
