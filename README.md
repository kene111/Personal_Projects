# Personal_Projects
These are my personal projects.

## Image_enhancing:
This project was done to try and improve the qualities of a low quality image based of the qualities of a better/higher quality image.

## Ireland_NewsClassifer:
My solution code to a kaggle competition. Dataset couldn't upload.

## kaggle_1 and kaggle_1_redo:
My solution code(rough work) to a kaggle competition. A neural network, a random forest and naive bayes classifier were used in kaggle_1 and a GRU was used in kaggle_1_redo. 

## Plane Crash and Plane_crash_upload:
My solution code to a HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge (link: https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/airplane-accident-severity-hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge/).
Plane Crash.ipynb has the rough work code using various classifiers and neural network, Plane_crash_upload.ipynb has the clean code for uploading.
