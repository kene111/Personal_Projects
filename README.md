# Personal_Projects
These are my personal projects.

## Image_enhancing:
This project was done to try and improve the qualities of a low quality image based of the qualities of a better/higher quality image.

## Ireland_NewsClassifer:
My solution code to a kaggle competition. Dataset couldn't upload.

## kaggle_1 and kaggle_1_redo:
My solution code(rough work) to a kaggle competition. A neural network, a random forest and naive bayes classifier were used in kaggle_1 and a GRU was used in kaggle_1_redo. 

## Plane Crash and Plane_crash_upload:
My solution code to a HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge (link: https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/airplane-accident-severity-hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge/).
Plane Crash.ipynb has the rough work code using various classifiers and neural network, Plane_crash_upload.ipynb has the clean code for uploading.

## Test Solutions:
These are my solutions to a test given to me by a financial technology start up company on sentiment analysis.
The text dataset used for digital banking, investment and savings, loans, and personal finance management were mined off nairaland and engineered to make analysis a lot easier. Some text data seem smaller than others, this was done to make sure the data gotten was as
useful as possible and not containing irrelevances.

## Pattern Detector
The pattern detector is a model that detects trends/patterns in a users daily transaction. The data was created by me due to the 
fact that I could not find any useful data online. The lstm model is trained on Book1.csv and then predicts Book2.csv. 
The model performed a poorly.I believe with large enough data, the model should perform better. This project is part of a larger project
 hence its functionality would be improved upon.
